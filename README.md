# Practical Machine learning Project Coursera

The Data comes from [Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#weight_lifting_exercises). They did a research on discriminating between different activities and how well the activity is done. Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), incorrectly performed are classified into Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E. The **Goal** of this project is to analyse this data and build a prediction algorithm to correctly classify new activities into Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E. 
The Project demonstrates performances of different algorithms and picks one with **low out of sample error**.
